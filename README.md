# ASCII-Game
A simple game made using Java to display ASCII art and choices which alter the storyline
Story idea: you ener your name and the name of a person you hate and love. Now there are two story lines with almost same plot. The person you loved has killed the one you hate and the one you hated killed the one you loved. Now the two storylines your are a investigator and have to find and tell who the criminal is. The psycological is here how you act when the person is different.

Game works by displaying paragraphs and you need to find clues. Enter keywords and find more info from them. Find clues in a certain time, 10 days before trial. If you do you win else you. There a different crime scenes and you need to find the clues. The alter the clues or report it.

This might require oop programing. Should I use Java or some other languange. Although I want to use JS and work this on the browers but IDK js that good yet so I have to do it in JAVA might get my oop skills better and a revise to JAVA. 
Man learning different languages at the same time is a pain in the ass, you keep mixing different shit...
